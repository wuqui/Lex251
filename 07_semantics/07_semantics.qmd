# Outline

- **Warm-up:** Your intuitions about **clippings**.
- **Theory:** The **Principle of No Synonymy** & **Distributional Hypothesis**.
- **Practice:** Analysing clippings with **corpus tools**.
- **Discussion:** Sharing your findings.

___

# Theory

___

## Warm-up exercise

- In pairs (2-3 mins):
    1.  Brainstorm 3-5 clippings in English (e.g., *uni*, *info*).
    2.  For each, discuss: Does the clipping mean *exactly* the same as the full word? If there are differences, what are they?
    3.  Are there situations where you would use one but not the other?

- Be prepared to share your examples!

___

## Research questions

Hilpert, Martin, David Correia Saavedra & Jennifer Rains. 2023. *Meaning Differences between English Clippings and Their Source Words: A Corpus-Based Study*. *ICAME Journal* 47 (1): 19–37. <https://doi.org/10.2478/icame-2023-0002>

- How do clippings (e.g. *dorm* < *dormitory*) and their source words differ in meaning?
- Are there semantic or pragmatic differences?
- Can we find generalisations about their meaning relations?
- How should we describe these relations?

(cf. Hilpert et al., 2023, p. 19)

___

## Abstract

- **Goal**: study meaning differences between clippings and source words.
- **Method**: corpus data and distributional semantics.
- **Data**: 50 English clippings, 100 examples each from COCA.
- **Findings**:
    - clippings appear in more "involved" contexts (→ signal familiarity).
    - clippings and source words have different distributional profiles.
- **Framework**: Construction Grammar, Principle of No Synonymy.

___

## Theoretical framework: Meaning of clippings

- One view: clippings and source words are alternatives that only differ in form, not meaning (Dressler 2000).
- Example: *mic* vs. *microphone*.

(cf. Hilpert et al., 2023, p. 20)

___

## Theoretical framework: Principle of no synonymy

- A difference in linguistic form always indicates a difference in meaning (Goldberg 1995).
- "Meaning" is broad: semantic, discourse-functional, interpersonal, etc.
- **Prediction**: clippings and source words should have distinct distributions, reflecting functional differences.

(cf. Hilpert et al., 2023, p. 21)

___

## Theoretical framework: Distributional hypothesis

- The meaning of words is reflected in their contextual elements in language use (Firth 1957).
- Words that appear in similar contexts share aspects of their meanings.
- Example: *cardiovascular* and *hypertension* share collocates like *heart*, *disease*, *diabetes*, *stroke*.

(cf. Hilpert et al., 2023, p. 21-22)

___

## Data

- Sample of 50 English clippings and their corresponding source words.
- Corpus data from COCA for each clipping and source word.

___

## Method

- Collocation analysis to investigate semantic profiles across contexts.
- Word embeddings to compare distributional profiles across text types and individual clippings.

___

## Results

### Variation across text types

___

# Practice

___

## Your Task

1.  Choose one of the word pairs from the Hilpert et al. (2023) study.
2.  Use the corpus methods we've just seen (collocations, word sketches) to analyse their differences.
3.  Use the "Guiding Questions" on the next slide to structure your analysis.
4.  Prepare to briefly share your findings with the class.

___

## Collocation analysis

1.  Run a query (e.g. `[word="brother"]`)

![](att/image_1684831483384_0.png)

___

2.  Click the collocation analysis icon

___

3.  Configure window range and statistics

![](att/image_1684832062090_0.png)

___

## Word sketches: Single forms

1\. Generate a word sketch for a clipped form (e.g. *bro*), specifying the word class.

___

2\. Examine syntactic contexts.

___

3\. Visualise results.

___

## Word sketches: Comparison

1. Compare source words and clipped forms (e.g. *brother* vs *bro*).

![](att/Pasted-image-20250612085053.png)

___

2. Review shared and unique collocates.

![](att/Pasted-image-20250612084821.png)

___

3. Inspect collocations in detail.

![](att/Pasted-image-20250612085147.png)

___

## Guiding questions

1. What is the general semantic signature of the source word?
2. What is the general semantic signature of the clipped form?
3. In what ways do they differ (stylistic, social, formality)?
4. Do they occur in different syntagmatic contexts despite similar denotation?
5. Does the clipped form have a narrower scope of meaning?

___

# Summary

- **A difference in form implies a difference in meaning.** (Principle of No Synonymy)
    - This applies even to seemingly simple shortenings like clippings.
- **Meaning is use.** The contexts a word appears in tell us about its function. (Distributional Hypothesis)
- **Clippings are not just lazy shortcuts.** They develop unique semantic, pragmatic, and social functions, often signalling familiarity and appearing in more "involved" contexts.
