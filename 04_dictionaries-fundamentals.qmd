# The Lexicon

## Two senses of *lexicon*

> “In the following, I will use *lexicon* in two senses that are not always sharply distinguished:  
> a) for a **metalinguistic level**, or a sub-component in a linguistic model; and  
> b) in the **sense of vocabulary** as seen from a systematic, synchronic point of view.”  
> [@Lipka1992OutlineEnglish, p. 11]

## Objective of lexicology

- “What is most important, however, is that in lexicology the stock of words or lexical items is not simply regarded as a **list of isolated elements**.  
- Lexicologists try to find out **generalisations** and **regularities** and especially consider **relations** between elements (see chapters n and IV).  
- Lexicology is therefore concerned with **structures**, not with a mere agglomeration of words (cf. [@Jackson1988Lexicology, p. 222]).”  
  [@Lipka1992OutlineEnglish, p. 1]

## Definition [@Bauer2022Introduction]

- “The lexicon is what linguists call the dictionary that is assumed to be **in people's heads**, or the linguist's best approximation to that.  
- It is fundamentally a *psychological entity*, and its contents cannot be observed directly but must be deduced from speakers' and hearers' **behaviour**.  
- Two fundamental approaches:  
  1. **Home of the lawless** [@DiSciulloWilliams1987] – lexicon contains whatever cannot be predicted by general rule.  
  2. Wider approach – lexicon contains anything to do with the **structure of words**, whether lawless or not.”

### Freudian slip [@Bauer2022Introduction]

“If you talk to someone about electricity, and then make them read the phrase *sham dock*, they might very well say *damn shock*, because of prior activation of related words; the Freudian slip depends upon a subject area being readily activated in the brain and brought out inadvertently, whether because of a word related in meaning or pronunciation.”

# Dictionaries [@Bauer2022Introduction]

## What is a *word*?

- “A word is listed in the dictionary.” (p. 2)  
  But:  
  - circular reasoning – words are listed *because* they are words  
  - dictionaries also list smaller units (e.g. prefix *un-*)
- “[...] in general we will accept the spelling conventions of English as defining words. This may not be terribly scientific, but it has the advantage of being practical.” (p. 3)

## Definition of *dictionary*

- “The term *dictionary* is usually restricted to real-world dictionaries that appear in print and online.
- Dictionaries provide a list of words of whatever language they deal with – in our case, English – and then give a certain amount of information about each of them.
- They tend to have two functions, which may at times conflict:
  1. **Describe** the language as it is (descriptive)  
  2. Provide an influence for establishing and maintaining the **standard** form of the language (prescriptive)”

### Descriptivism vs prescriptivism

> “If we assume that one of *'kilometre* and *ki'lometre* is right (and the other therefore wrong), we assume that there is a **unique solution** to this question of English usage …” (Bauer)

Language questions are more often like the *jeans* question (multiple acceptable answers) than like the *drive-on-the-right* question (single legal answer).

## Proof of the existence of words

“First of all, dictionaries provide evidence of the existence of a word.  The fact that a word is listed in a dictionary at all is taken to prove that there is such a word.  This can be misleading in two ways:

1. Dictionaries **sometimes list erroneous words** that have no existence outside the dictionary (e.g. *banket*, *sardel*).  
2. Dictionaries more often **fail to list perfectly good words** – no dictionary can list every word of English.”

### Term-paper idea

- Which words are commonly used (in corpora) but **not** contained in dictionaries?  
- Which words are contained in dictionaries but **not** commonly used in corpora?

# Practice: Investigating lexical innovation since 2000 using the OED

### Task 1 – Advanced search

Use the OED Advanced search to find all lexemes whose **first use** is **after 2000**.

![](att/image_1700133799936_0.png){width="600"}

Export the results to a `.csv` file.

### Task 2 – Analyse in Microsoft Excel

Guiding questions:

- Which **word-formation processes** are most frequent?  
- Which **word classes** are most frequent?  
- Which **subject areas** are most frequent?

Steps:

1. Save the exported file as `xlsx`.  
2. Create a **Table** containing the data (Insert → Table).  
3. Insert a **Pivot Table** to analyse process, class, subject.  
4. Compare findings with compounding.
