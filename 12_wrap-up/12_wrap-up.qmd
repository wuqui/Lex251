# Course Journey

## From dictionaries to dynamic systems

::: {.incremental}
- **Started with**: What is a word? Dictionary entries and static definitions 
  - e.g. OED analysis of *bro*, spelling conventions defining words, Urban Dictionary vs Wiktionary approaches
- **Explored**: Morphological processes creating new words 
  - e.g. *disclaimers* morphological analysis, *Brangelina* blending, *selfie* clipping, word-formation productivity in OED
- **Discovered**: Words carry meaning through context and collocation 
  - e.g. *cardiovascular* vs *cardio* distributional differences, *bro* vs *brother* collocational patterns, Principle of No Synonymy
- **Examined**: How vocabulary changes across time and varies across users 
  - e.g. *telephone* → *phone* frequency decline, *autumn* vs *fall* regional variation, modal verb changes in COHA
- **Concluded**: The lexicon as a living, adaptive system 
  - e.g. S-curve model of *smartphone* diffusion, EC-Model of entrenchment and conventionalisation, social network effects

# Theoretical Integration {#integration}

## The lexicon as a dynamic system

| Traditional view                      | Dynamic view                              | Examples from our course |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Words as **discrete units**            | Words as **usage patterns**               | *bro* vs *brother* collocational differences |
| Meaning as **fixed definitions**       | Meaning through **distributional patterns**| *cardiovascular* vs *cardio* semantic profiles |
| Vocabulary as **inventory**            | Vocabulary as **adaptive system**         | S-curve model of *smartphone* diffusion |
| Change as **exceptional**              | Change as **inherent property**           | *telephone* → *phone* frequency decline |

## Core principles we've discovered

::: {.incremental}
1. **No synonymy principle**: Formal differences signal meaning differences
   - *cardiovascular* vs *cardio* have different semantic profiles despite similar denotation
2. **Usage-based dynamics**: Frequency patterns reveal entrenchment
   - *smartphone* shows S-curve diffusion pattern from innovation to conventionalisation
3. **Distributional meaning**: Context shapes and constrains interpretation  
   - *bro* vs *brother* have different collocational patterns reflecting distinct social functions
4. **Systematic variation**: Social and situational factors drive patterned differences
   - *autumn* vs *fall* show regional variation, modal verbs show register differences
5. **Historical layering**: Contemporary vocabulary reflects cultural contact and change
   - English lexicon shows Germanic core + French/Latin borrowings + global loanwords

- Temporal variation tracking
- Register/genre differences
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### **Quantitative analysis**

- Tables and Pivot Tables
- Visualization techniques

- Theory-data integration
- Hypothesis testing
:::

::::

## Multi-method triangulation

::: {.fragment}
**Example: Modal verb change**

- **Dictionary**: Semantic evolution of *must* vs *have to*
- **Corpus**: COHA frequency patterns 1850-2000  
- **Statistics**: Variation coefficients across text types
- **Theory**: Grammaticalization and register specialization
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Result**: Converging evidence for systematic functional differentiation

# Examples

## Example 1: Tracking lexical obsolescence

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](att/telephone_frequency_decline.png)

**The case of *telephone***

- OED: First attested 1844
- COCA analysis: Peak usage 1990s
- Current trend: Replaced by *phone*
- Method: Frequency tracking over time
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](att/walkman_frequency_decline.png){width=70%}

**The case of *walkman***

- Technology-specific term
- Clear rise and fall pattern
- Cultural obsolescence → lexical obsolescence
- Method: Historical corpus analysis
:::

::::

## Example 2: Semantic innovation with *bro*

![](att/bro_coca_analysis.png){.r-stretch}

**From kinship to solidarity marker**

- Original meaning: 'brother' (family relation)
- New meaning: 'close male friend' (social relation)
- Corpus evidence: 
  - Text type specialization
  - Different collocational patterns
- Method: Distributional semantic analysis

## Example 3: Innovation diffusion patterns

![](att/s_curve_model.png)

**The S-curve model in practice**

- **Slow start**: Few early adopters
- **Rapid growth**: Social network effects  
- **Plateau**: Market saturation
- **Applications**: *smartphone*, *Covid-19*, *selfie*

## Example 4: Corpus analysis methods

**Sketch Engine frequency analysis**

- Creating your own corpora
- Querying corpora
- Frequency analysis: linguistic patterns, change, and variation
- Collocations and word sketches

# Research Applications {#applications}

## Beyond lexicology

### Where these skills apply:

- **Sociolinguistics**: Variation patterns in any linguistic feature
    - *ain't* vs *am not* across education levels
- **Historical linguistics**: Change mechanisms across language levels  
    - COHA collocates of *gay* showing semantic shift over time
- **Corpus linguistics**: Empirical validation of theoretical claims
    - word sketch comparison of *bro* vs *brother* in Sketch Engine
- **Applied linguistics**: Language teaching and lexicography
    - designing vocabulary lists and exercises based on corpus data
- **Digital humanities**: Text mining and cultural analytics
    - social network analysis of *hashtag* diffusion on Twitter
- **Discourse analysis**: Context-meaning relationships
    - collocation analysis of *problem* across text types

## Research questions we can now tackle

2. What **social factors** drive lexical innovation in specific domains?
3. How does **register variation** interact with historical change?
4. What **cognitive mechanisms** underlie entrenchment processes?
5. How do **contact situations** shape borrowing patterns?

# Reflection and Assessment {#reflection}

1. What do you find most interesting about the lexicon and lexicology?
2. Which skills and methods do you find most useful? How could you apply them?


## Course evaluation

1. What worked well?
2. What could be improved?
3. Suggestions for future iterations?


## Final thoughts

> The vocabulary of a language is not simply a list of words, but a structured system that reflects the history, culture, and cognitive patterns of its speakers.

**You now have the tools to:**

- **Analyze** lexical patterns systematically  
- **Apply** empirical methods rigorously
- **Interpret** variation and change theoretically
- **Connect** linguistic data to broader questions
