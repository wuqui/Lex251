# Introduction

## Introduction to Lexicology and Lexicography

### What is Lexicology about?

#### What is a *word*?

##### How many words?

Consider this example:

> Paul was drinking beer in his favourite bar. He enjoyed having a drink every now and then. He thought he did not drink much, but his wife thought that he drank.

→ 31 running words/tokens

###### How many words are there?

|     | type       | token      |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1   | DRINK $^v$ | *drinking* |
|     |            | *drink*    |
|     |            | *drunk*    |
| 2   | DRINK $^n$ | *drink*    |

- *tokens*: *he*$^1$, *he*$^2$, etc.
- *word forms*: *drinking*, *drank* are word forms of the lexeme DRINK$^v$
- *types/lexemes*: e.g. DRINK$^v$

Other terms – e.g. *disclaimers*

##### Model of the linguistic sign [@Saussure1916Cours]

There are three notions of *words*:

- *types* / *lexemes*:
    - lexical items as listed in the dictionary,
    - abstract units of the lexicon: WORK $^v$
- *word-forms*:
    - inflectional variants of lexemes
    - e.g. *(he) works*, *(he) worked*
- *tokens*:
    - concrete instantiations of types in running text,
    - commonly delimited by whitespace

##### Types of signs [@Keller1994Sprachwandel]

- indices: relation of *naturalness*
- icons: relation of *similarity*
- symbols: relation of *arbitrariness*

##### Function of words in communication

#### Objective of Lexicology

- “What is most important, however, is that in lexicology the stock of words or lexical items is not simply regarded as a list of *isolated elements*.
- Lexicologists try to find out *generalisations* and *regularities* and especially consider *relations* between elements.
- Lexicology is therefore concerned with *structures*, not with a mere agglomeration of words (cf. @Jackson1988Lexicology, p. 222).”  
  [@Lipka1992OutlineEnglish, p. 1]

### What is the *lexicon*?

#### Two senses of *lexicon*

> “In the following, I will use *lexicon* in two senses that are not always sharply distinguished:
>
> 1. a) for a *metalinguistic* level, or a sub-component in a linguistic model (basically compatible with a variety of theories of language); and
> 2. b) in the sense of *vocabulary* as seen from a *systematic, synchronic* point of view.”  
>  [@Lipka1992OutlineEnglish, p. 11]

#### Dimensions of structure in the lexicon

- internal vs external:

## Practice: using dictionaries for studying lexis

Which types of lexical information can you find in the OED?

- phonology
- word-formation
- semantics
- sociolinguistics
- register
- usage frequency
