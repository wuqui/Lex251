# Recap: From words to innovation {.slide #warm-up}

::: {.notes}
- **8:32 - Start warm-up (5 mins total)**
- **8:35 - Pair sharing (2 mins)**
- Connect previous sessions to today's innovation focus
:::

**Recap questions** (2 minutes in pairs):

1. [**Word formation processes**: Which processes create completely new word forms?]{.fragment}
2. [**Semantic change**: How can existing words develop new meanings?]{.fragment}
3. [**Dictionary evidence**: How do dictionaries track and document new words?]{.fragment}

. . . 

**Today's focus**: How do these processes work in real time? What drives innovation and how does it spread?

# Research foundation {.slide #research-foundation}

::: {.notes}
**8:37 - Introduce key study (3 mins)**
:::

## Social networks of lexical innovation 

**@Wurschinger2021Social**: *Social Networks of Lexical Innovation. Investigating the Social Dynamics of Diffusion of Neologisms on Twitter*

### Research approach

- **Longitudinal study**: 99 English neologisms tracked on Twitter
- **Multi-method analysis**: Frequency measures + social network analysis  
- **Temporal dynamics**: Usage patterns, volatility, and diffusion over time
- **Social pathways**: How innovations spread through communities

<!-- . . .  -->

### Key insights

- **Frequency alone is insufficient** - need temporal and social information
- **Social diffusion varies significantly** - even words with similar frequency show different patterns

## Today's session structure {.slide}

::: {.notes}
**8:40 - Session roadmap (2 mins)**
:::

We'll explore the theoretical framework and empirical findings:

1. **Theoretical models**: S-curve and EC-Model for understanding innovation
2. **Operationalisation**: How to measure diffusion using corpus methods
3. **Practical application**: Hands-on analysis with case study words
4. **Comparative analysis**: Your findings vs. published research

. . .

**Goal**: Understand both the theory and practice of studying lexical innovation

# The interplay of cultural and linguistic innovation {.slide #cultural-linguistic}

::: {.notes}
**8:42 - Cultural-linguistic section start (15 mins total)**
:::

## Society and language change {.slide #society-and-language-change}

::: {.notes}
**8:38**
:::

**Key principle**: Society continually changes as new practices and products emerge.

- These changes typically **first manifest themselves in language** on the level of lexis.
- Language change occurs through **neologisms** (new words or new meanings).
- **Knowledge of words is conventional**: speakers learn form-meaning pairings.


## Types of neologisms {.slide #types-of-neologisms}

::: {.notes}
**8:40**
:::

**Formal neologisms**

::: {.fragment}
- *smartphone*
- *iPhone* 
- *Covid*
:::

**Semantic neologisms**

::: {.fragment}
- *hotspot* (from physical location → infection cluster)
- *Querdenker* (lateral thinker → conspiracy theorist)
- *social distancing*
- *spreader* (person → virus transmitter)
:::

## Lexical renaissance {.slide #lexical-renaissance}

::: {.notes}
**8:42**
:::

**Innovation after lexical attrition**: old words returning to use.

**Examples**:

- *dotard* (revived during political discourse)
- *to furlough* (returned during economic crises)

Pattern: Social changes can revive forgotten vocabulary when circumstances make old words newly relevant.

# The S-curve model of lexical innovation {.slide #s-curve-model}

**8:45 - Models section start (18 mins total)**

## Integration of diffusion stages

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Early adoption**: Innovative users introduce new words.

**Acceleration**: Rapid spread through social networks.

**Deceleration**: Slower growth as market saturates.

**Stabilisation**: Word becomes established in conventional usage.

# Operationalisation: frequency as indicator {.slide #operationalisation}

::: {.notes}
**9:02**
:::

## Theoretical foundation

**Frequency** as indicator for entrenchment and conventionality [@Stefanowitsch2017Corpusbased]:

- **Corpus-as-input**: language in corpora represents potential exposure to speakers.
- **Corpus-as-output**: language used by speakers represents degrees of entrenchment.

## Frequency measures {.slide}

::: {.notes}
**9:04**
:::

**Examples from @Wurschinger2021Social**:

### Total frequency patterns

#### Most frequent:

# Practice: identifying pattern of lexical innovation

## OED’s Advanced Search

Use the OED’s Advanced Search to retrieve all words that have first been used since 2000.

![](att/oed-advanced-search.png)

Export the results as a `csv` file.

## Excel analysis

Model sheet: <https://1drv.ms/x/c/9a2ec97d593520f9/EbTMdPaevpFJqGqbQT43l3YBf2Pg02PJ8On1XOLh1JiBcA>

1. import the `csv` file into Excel
2. create a `Table` that spans the imported data (without metadata)
3. created `Pivot Table`s to analyse the data

Analysis:

1. What are the most frequent word classes among the target neologisms?
2. What is their distribution across dates of first use?
3. Which word-formation processes are most common?
4. Which subject areas are most prevalent?


## Sketch Engine analysis

Use Sketch Engine and the BNC 2014 Spoken to analyse the frequency and distribution of the target neologisms.

1. In Excel, selected a sample (e.g. `n=20`) of the target neologisms based on frequency (column `Frequency Band Number`).

2. In Sketch Engine, search for all of these neologisms in one go by concatenating them in a single CQL query. For example:

```
[word="retweet|hashtag|podcast|stan|Covid-19|photobomb|upvote|Covid|deadname|Bitcoin|stablecoin|selfie|SARS|open-world|vlog|vape"]
```

___

Analyse the results by using the `Frequency` tool.

![](att/ske-freq-analysis.png)

___

1. Frequency by `word`:

![](att/ske-freq-by-word.png)

___

2. Frequency by `Age range`:

# Summary {.slide #summary}
