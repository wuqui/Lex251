# Lexicology Seminar Presentation Structure

This rule outlines the standard structure for seminar presentations in the "Lexicology" course.

## Standard Sections

A typical presentation should include the following sections, in this order:

1.  **Outline**: A brief overview of the presentation topics.
2.  **Warm-up**: An interactive exercise to engage students.
3.  **Theory**: Introduction of key theoretical concepts. 
4.  **Practical Examples**: Demonstrations using specific tools or examples (e.g., OED, Wiktionary).
5.  **Practice Session**: A hands-on exercise for students to apply the concepts.
6.  **Summary**: A concluding slide with key takeaways.

## Formatting Conventions

- Use `___` to create new slides.
- Use `:::{.small}` to shrink the text on content-heavy slides. This class is defined in [`custom.css`](mdc:custom.css).
