## Warm-up exercise

In pairs (2-3 mins):

1. What dictionaries do you use most often? (e.g., Google, DeepL, OED, Duden)
2. What do you use them for? (e.g., checking spelling, finding a translation, understanding a definition)

# Practice

::: {.small}
- In pairs, choose one **general-purpose dictionary** and one **specialised dictionary**. Compare how they define:
    - a common word (e.g. *house*): note the **word class** and any **morphological information**
    - a technical term (e.g. *algorithm*): identify **derivation** and **affixation** details
    - slang (e.g. *selfie*): discuss the **word-formation process** (e.g. blending, clipping)
- List the types of **linguistic information** provided in each entry (e.g. morphology, syntax, pronunciation, etymology, usage examples, frequency, collocations)
- Consult a **bilingual dictionary** entry for a word of your choice in two different language pairs. Analyse how translation equivalents, word class, and usage notes differ
- Reflect on which dictionary type best supports analysis of **word classes** and **word-formation processes** for your research; prepare a short summary (2–3 sentences)

# Practise using the OED

**Using the OED's Advanced Search**:

- sort them by `Date (newest first)`
- export the results as a **CSV file**

___

**Using Microsoft Excel**:

1. open the **CSV file**
2. save the file as an Excel file (`.xlsx` extension)
3. convert the exported rows/columns to a `Table`
4. create **`Pivot Table`s** to analyse the data
5. create **`Pivot Chart`s** to visualise the data

Model Excel file: <https://1drv.ms/x/c/9a2ec97d593520f9/EaLL88w43gZCrHEXDYO5Qa0BRPZiuRcROamaxi4AJhFTsg>

___

**Analysis objectives**:

1. How many terms are marked as ***obsolete*** across the whole OED?
2. What are the most common **word classes** of obsolete terms?
3. What are the most common **word-formation processes**?
4. What are the most common **subjects**?

# Summary

- **Dictionaries are not monolithic.** Different types—general, specialised, bilingual, diachronic—serve different purposes.
- **Choose the right tool for the job.** The best dictionary for your research depends on your specific questions (e.g., historical development, contemporary slang, cross-linguistic comparison).
- **Dictionaries are data.** They are curated datasets that can be used for qualitative and quantitative linguistic analysis, revealing patterns in word formation, semantic change, and language use.
