# What is a word? [@Bauer2022Introduction]

## Criteria

- utterance  
    - "A word is the smallest unit which can stand on its own as an utterance." (p. 1)  
    - but: 
        - *mentioning*
            - A: *Is it 'inadvisable' or 'unadvisable'?*  
            - B: *Un.*  
        - grammatical words: e.g. *the*
- phonology  
    - "A word is a unit which, when pronounced in isolation, has a single intonational focus point, or movement of pitch." (p. 2)  
    - but:  
        - *in the beginning* vs *first* vs *forever* vs *for ever*
- meaning  
    - "A word has a single, unitary meaning." (p. 2)  
    - but:  
        - *finally* vs *in the end*
- spelling  
    - "words are unitary orthographic units" (p. 2)  
    - but:  
        - *coffee pot* vs *coffee-pot*  
        - *in so far as* vs *in-so-far-as*  
        - diachronic change: *all right* vs *alright*
- dictionary entry  
    - "A word is listed in the dictionary." (p. 2)  
    - but:  
        - circular reasoning: words are listed *because* they are words  
        - dictionaries also list smaller units (e.g. prefix *un-*)
- practical definition  
    - "[…] in general we will accept the spelling conventions of English as defining words. This might not be terribly scientific, but it has the advantage of being practical." (p. 3)

## Problems in delineating the term *word*

### Names

- "A word is a linguistic item which helps us discuss the world around us.  
  It is a unit which not only has **form** (a phonological structure or an orthographic one), but also **meaning**.  
  In this sense, names are words. But names are different from other words in a number of ways. They have unique **reference**: *Samantha* refers to one particular person in a given context, *tree* refers to a set of items, one or more of which is relevant in the given context."
- Semiotic Triangle [@Ogden1923Meaning]:
    - ![](att/image_1698949528283_0.png){width="425"}
- definite reference examples:  
    - **the Samantha**  
  – *This is not the Paris I used to know.* (use as common noun)
- roles as noun phrases – no modifiers:  
  *the former Argentine*

### Multi-word expressions (MWE)

#### Compounds

- *passion flower*  
- *sunflower*  
- *wall-flower*
- onomasiological competition between formal variants:  
  – *honey bee*  
  – *honeybee*

#### Phrasal verbs

- *He **passed out***.  
- *He **fainted***.

#### Collocations

- collocation continuum  
  - strong collocations: *kith and kin*  
  - intermediate  
    – *all things considered*  
    – *as a matter of fact*  
    – *excuse me*  
    – *good afternoon*  
    – *I'm sorry to say*  
    – *in other words*  
    – *in the long run*  
  - weak collocations: *in the*

#### Idioms

- *He **kicked the bucket***.  
- *He **died***.

#### Proverbs

- *Too many cooks spoil the broth.*  
- \*_The broth has been spoilt by too many cooks._

### Paradigms

#### Inflectional paradigms

> "The term 'paradigm' is in general usage, but its usage is often limited. Although *paradigm* can justifiably be used of any substitution class, it is most often used of substitution classes within the word. Thus the normal use for the term *paradigm* is the kind of substitution class illustrated in the following example." (Bauer)

(12)

- *walk*  
- *walks*  
- *walked*  
- *walking*

This paradigm illustrates two different kinds of word: there is a sense in which all the items are different **word-forms**, and a contrasting sense in which the paradigm illustrates different uses of the same word, the **lexeme**.”

#### Derivational paradigms

(13)

|                | *deceive*   | *employ*     | *proceed*    | *theorise*     |
|:--------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| **Verb**       | *deceive*   | *employ*     | *proceed*    | *theorise*     |
| **Noun**       | *deception* | *employer*   | *process*    | *theory*       |
| **Adjective**  | *deceptive* | *employable* | *processual* | *theoretical*  |

Although these examples show individual word families, these series are often generalised over several word families (e.g. *theory*/*theorist*/*theorise* parallels *fantasy*/*fantasist*/*fantasise*).


# Practice: Using the OED

1. Which types of ‘problematic cases’ of words are included in the OED?  
2. What kind of information does the OED provide about their atypical features?

Candidate types

- spelling variation
- compounds
- phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs
- collocations, idioms, and proverbs
