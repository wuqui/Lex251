Studying collocations can reveal important information about word usage, meaning, and associations.\n\n\n\nFrequency analysis involves counting the occurrences of linguistic features, such as words or structures, within a corpus. This helps researchers identify patterns and trends, as well as compare language use across different corpora.\n\n\n\nN-grams are sequences of n contiguous words or linguistic units within a text. They can be used to study word combinations, patterns, and structures in a corpus.\n\nExample: The cat sat on the mat.\n\nbigrams (2-grams)\n\nThe cat\ncat sat\nsat on\n…\n\n\nExample corpus: Google Books Ngram Viewer – a web-based tool that allows users to search and visualise word frequencies across millions of books from 1500-2019.\n\n\n\n\nRegister refers to the language variety used in specific contexts or situations, characterised by particular linguistic features, such as vocabulary, grammar, and style. Examining registers can help researchers understand language variation and adaptation."

More specifically, we investigate meaning differences between clippings and their source words. Are there semantic or pragmatic differences between pairs such as dorm and dormitory, and if so, what are they? Is it possible to formulate generalisations that capture how clippings and their source words relate to one another with regard to meaning? How should these relations be described?” (Hilpert et al. 2023: 19)"

Jackson (1988), p. 222).”\n(Lipka 1992, 1)\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the lexicon?\n\nTwo senses of lexicon\n\n“In the following, I will use lexicon in two senses that are not always sharply distinguished:\n\n\nfor a metalinguistic level, or a sub-component in a linguistic model (basically compatible with a variety of theories of language); and\n\n\nin the sense of vocabulary as seen from a systematic, synchronic point of view.”\n(Lipka 1992, 11)\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions of structure in the lexicon\n\ninternal vs external:\n\nparadigmatic vs syntagmatic:\n\n\n\n\nFunction of Lexicology in language"
